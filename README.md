### ‚öôÔ∏è Functionality & Behavior

Our wooden shulker boxes are designed to be intuitive and useful:

* **Inventory Space**: Each box provides 9 slots to store your items.
* **Smooth Animations & Sounds**: Enjoy satisfying opening and closing animations, complete with distinct sound effects.
* **Item Restrictions**: Just like their vanilla counterparts, wooden shulker boxes cannot be placed inside other shulker boxes (vanilla or wooden), based on the `simpleshulkers:disallowed_in_shulker_boxes` item tag.
* **At-a-Glance Tooltip**: Hover over a wooden shulker box in your inventory to instantly see its contents!
    * Displays up to 5 items.
    * If more than 5 items are present, it will show "\[X] more items...".
    * If empty, the tooltip will clearly state "Empty".
* **Preserves Contents**: When a placed wooden shulker box is broken, it drops itself as an item, keeping all its contents safely inside.
* **Dispenser Friendly**: Wooden shulker boxes can be placed and dispensed by Dispensers, just like vanilla shulker boxes.

### üé® Creative Mode Integration

All new items, including the wooden shulker shells and the three types of wooden shulker boxes, are conveniently located under a dedicated "Simple Shulkers" tab in the Creative inventory for easy access.

* **Enhanced Configuration**: Implementing more detailed server-side configuration options for pack makers, such as tweaking recipes, capacities, or which shulkers are enabled.
* **Visual Polish**: Continuously improving models, textures, and animations for a premium feel.
