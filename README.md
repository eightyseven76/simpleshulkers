### 📦 Wooden Shulker Boxes & Crafting

Get your hands on these handy storage solutions with a straightforward two-step crafting process:

1.  **Craft Wooden Shulker Shells**:
    You'll first need to craft specialized wooden shulker shells from their respective logs. Each recipe uses 5 logs in a 'U' shape with an extra log on each side of the top row.
    * **Oak Shulker Shell**: Crafted using 5 Oak Logs.
    * **Spruce Shulker Shell**: Crafted using 5 Spruce Logs.
    * **Birch Shulker Shell**: Crafted using 5 Birch Logs.

    *(Example: Oak Shulker Shell. Ensure you have an 'oak_shulker_shell_recipe.png' in your 'images' folder or update this link!)*

2.  **Craft Wooden Shulker Boxes**:
    Once you have two shulker shells of the same wood type, combine them with a standard vanilla Chest to create your wooden shulker box. The recipe is a vertical arrangement: Shell, Chest, Shell.
    * **Oak Shulker Box**: Crafted with 2 Oak Shulker Shells and 1 Chest.
    * **Spruce Shulker Box**: Crafted with 2 Spruce Shulker Shells and 1 Chest.
    * **Birch Shulker Box**: Crafted with 2 Birch Shulker Shells and 1 Chest.

### ⚙️ Functionality & Behavior

Our wooden shulker boxes are designed to be intuitive and useful:

* **Inventory Space**: Each box provides 9 slots to store your items.
* **Smooth Animations & Sounds**: Enjoy satisfying opening and closing animations, complete with distinct sound effects.
* **Item Restrictions**: Just like their vanilla counterparts, wooden shulker boxes cannot be placed inside other shulker boxes (vanilla or wooden), based on the `simpleshulkers:disallowed_in_shulker_boxes` item tag.
* **At-a-Glance Tooltip**: Hover over a wooden shulker box in your inventory to instantly see its contents!
    * Displays up to 5 items.
    * If more than 5 items are present, it will show "\[X] more items...".
    * If empty, the tooltip will clearly state "Empty".
* **Preserves Contents**: When a placed wooden shulker box is broken, it drops itself as an item, keeping all its contents safely inside.
* **Dispenser Friendly**: Wooden shulker boxes can be placed and dispensed by Dispensers, just like vanilla shulker boxes.

All new items, including the wooden shulker shells and the three types of wooden shulker boxes, are conveniently located under a dedicated "Simple Shulkers" tab in the Creative inventory for easy access.
