Get your hands on these handy storage solutions with a straightforward two-step crafting process:

    * **Oak Shulker Shell**: Crafted using 5 Oak Logs.
    * **Spruce Shulker Shell**: Crafted using 5 Spruce Logs.
    * **Birch Shulker Shell**: Crafted using 5 Birch Logs.

2.  **Craft Wooden Shulker Boxes**:
    Once you have two shulker shells of the same wood type, combine them with a standard vanilla Chest to create your wooden shulker box. The recipe is a vertical arrangement: Shell, Chest, Shell.
    * **Oak Shulker Box**: Crafted with 2 Oak Shulker Shells and 1 Chest.
    * **Spruce Shulker Box**: Crafted with 2 Spruce Shulker Shells and 1 Chest.
    * **Birch Shulker Box**: Crafted with 2 Birch Shulker Shells and 1 Chest.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Functionality & Behavior

Our wooden shulker boxes are designed to be intuitive and useful:

* **Inventory Space**: Each box provides 9 slots to store your items.
* **Smooth Animations & Sounds**: Enjoy satisfying opening and closing animations, complete with distinct sound effects.
* **Item Restrictions**: Just like their vanilla counterparts, wooden shulker boxes cannot be placed inside other shulker boxes (vanilla or wooden), based on the `simpleshulkers:disallowed_in_shulker_boxes` item tag.
* **At-a-Glance Tooltip**: Hover over a wooden shulker box in your inventory to instantly see its contents!
    * Displays up to 5 items.
    * If more than 5 items are present, it will show "\[X] more items...".
    * If empty, the tooltip will clearly state "Empty".
* **Preserves Contents**: When a placed wooden shulker box is broken, it drops itself as an item, keeping all its contents safely inside.
* **Dispenser Friendly**: Wooden shulker boxes can be placed and dispensed by Dispensers, just like vanilla shulker boxes.

* **Enhanced Configuration**: Implementing more detailed server-side configuration options for pack makers, such as tweaking recipes, capacities, or which shulkers are enabled.
* **Visual Polish**: Continuously improving models, textures, and animations for a premium feel.
