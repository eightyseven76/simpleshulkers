‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Q: Can I use this mod in my modpack?
A: Yes! You are absolutely free to include Simple Shulkers in your modpacks under the terms of the MIT License. We appreciate attribution to the mod and a link back to this page, but it's not strictly required by the license.

Q: Will you be adding more wood types or features?
A: This is an early alpha release! We're starting with Oak, Spruce, and Birch to establish the core functionality. We are open to feedback and suggestions for additional wood types (e.g., Dark Oak, Acacia, Jungle, Cherry, Mangrove, Bamboo) or other features (e.g., coloring, different tier sizes, automation integration). Join our community discussions or create a suggestion on our [GitHub Issues Page]([Link to your GitHub Issues page])!

Q: Is this mod compatible with other storage mods like Refined Storage or Applied Energistics 2?
A: Simple Shulkers is designed to be highly compatible with most other mods. While we don't have specific integrations with complex tech mods like RS or AE2, the wooden shulker boxes function like vanilla shulker boxes, meaning they can generally be placed and their contents accessed as normal. If you encounter any specific compatibility issues, please report them!

Q: Will this mod be updated for future Minecraft versions?
A: Our goal is to keep Simple Shulkers updated for new stable Minecraft versions as they are released, as long as development remains feasible and there is interest from the community.

Q: Why don't the wooden shulker boxes offer more inventory slots?
A: The design choice for 9 slots is intentional. It provides a significant early-game inventory boost without fully replacing the need for larger, later-game storage solutions (like vanilla shulker boxes from The End). This helps maintain game progression and balances the mod's early-game accessibility.
